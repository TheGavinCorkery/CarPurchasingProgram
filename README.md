# CarPurchasingProgram

DISCLAIMER: All of my code to write the program can be found in the src folder.

I developed this program from scratch for my final exam in my Java class

This program is designed to allow a user to look at the cars that we have for sale, add them to their cart, then purchase the cars
The user can also get a list of the cars that they have in their cart, clear their cart, and even add multiple quantities to purchase at a time
The program will also create a list of all the cars in the users cart and write it into a seperate text file.
