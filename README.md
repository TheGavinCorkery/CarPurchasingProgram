# CarPurchasingProgram

I developed this program from scratch for my final exam in my Java class

This program is designed to allow a user to look at the cars that we have for sale, add them to their cart, then purchase the cars
The user can also get a list of the cars that they have in their cart, clear their cart, and even add multiple quantities to purchase at a time
Afte the user decided to purchase the items in their cart, the program will then create a list of all the cars for them, and write it into a seperate text file.
